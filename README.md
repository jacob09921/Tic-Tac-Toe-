# Tic-Tac-Toe-

Hello Guys, I made Tic Tac Toe using html css, and javascript. I find this challenging due to the fact that this is my first project that I made without looking to tuitorials and google which is hopefully nice and escaped tuitorial hell. I learned html, css and javascript with the udemy bootcamp of Mr. Colt Steale. I use the concepts that he teached at his bootcamp in implementing crucial part of my project which is Tic Tac Toe. For example. using this component, function, dom manipulation and so on. I am so happy that I am kinda confident on getting my hands dirty. Due to this outcome, I will contiune learning as a beginner to become a suficcient and helpful developer. 


How do I plan creating this Tic Tac Toe? 

I focus on the concepts of the fundamentals provided by the javascirpt. In other words, I brainstomred a lot on how to pull it off like resseting the game, first click should be X, disabling the button when clicked, containing variables, implementing conditions and getting the winning, draw, and losing part. In css, I'm using flexbox to get the alignment of the content and let the content become responsive. In other words, I am kinda experimenting the design of the website. As the project processes, my intuition becomes fighter and finally pull off the correct function of the Tic Tac Toe. I made this project for 4 hours.
