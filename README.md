# Tic-Tac-Toe-

Hello Guys, I made Tic Tac Toe using HTMl CSS and Javascript. I find this challenging since this is the first project that I made without looking to tutorials and Google which is hopefully nice and escaped tutorial hell. I learned HTML, CSS, and javascript with the Udemy bootcamp of Mr. Colt Steale. I use the concepts that he taught at his boot camp in implementing a crucial part of my project which is Tic Tac Toe. For example. using this component, function, dom manipulation, and so on. I am so happy that I am kinda confident about getting my hands dirty. Due to this outcome, I will continue learning as a beginner to become a sufficient and helpful developer.


How do I plan to create this Tic Tac Toe?
I focus on the concepts of the fundamentals provided by the javascript. In other words, I brainstormed a lot on how to pull it off like resetting the game, the first click should be X, disabling the button when clicked, containing variables, implementing conditions, and getting the winning, draw, and losing part. In CSS, I'm using Flexbox to get the alignment of the content and let the content become responsive. In other words, I am kinda experimenting with the design of the website. As the project processes, my intuition becomes a fighter and finally pull off the correct function of the Tic Tac Toe. I made this project for 4 hours.
